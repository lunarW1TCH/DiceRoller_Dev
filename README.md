Above is the link to the deployed project.

This is the first website I ever made. It is written in Html, CSS and Javascript only.

User can roll most commonly used dice in tabletop rpg games (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20). Results save so that most recent rolls can be viewed.
I also included dark mode.
